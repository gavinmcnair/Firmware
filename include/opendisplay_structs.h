/* ==========================================================================
 * opendisplay_structs.h  --  OpenDisplay config & message wire-payload contract
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   Single source of truth for the LAYOUT of every payload that travels on the
 *   OpenDisplay BLE wire: the config-transfer TLV packets (CONFIG_WRITE /
 *   CONFIG_READ bodies), the fixed-size opcode message payloads (PIPE, partial
 *   write, auth, LED flash), and the BLE manufacturer-specific advertisement.
 *   Where opendisplay_protocol.h owns the FRAMING (opcodes, response/status
 *   bytes, errors, envelope), THIS file owns the CONTENTS -- the real C enums,
 *   bitfield definitions, and packed structs that describe those bytes.
 *
 *   A new engineer or an AI agent should be able to hand-decode a captured
 *   config blob or advertisement BYTE-BY-BYTE from THIS FILE ALONE: every field
 *   is documented in wire order with its meaning, valid values, units, default,
 *   and endianness. This header is also the CODEGEN SOURCE -- the machine-
 *   readable `@tag` annotations drive generation of the Swift / Python / JS
 *   type mirrors (see docs/shared-types-plan.md); codegen must carry the prose
 *   through as idiomatic doc comments in each target language.
 *
 *   OD_STRUCTS_VERSION  2.0   (MAJOR.MINOR spec marker for THIS file; see
 *                              VERSIONING POLICY below -- NOT sent on the wire)
 *   LAST CHANGED        2026-07-18
 *
 *   The two version schemes carried here are DISTINCT (see §6 Q2 of the plan):
 *     - OD_STRUCTS_VERSION_* : documents this spec file, like protocol.h's
 *       OD_PROTOCOL_VERSION. A compatibility marker; never transmitted.
 *     - OD_CONFIG_VERSION / OD_CONFIG_MINOR_VERSION : the ON-WIRE config-format
 *       version (currently 1 / 4). The OuterPacketHeader.version byte transmits
 *       the MAJOR; the minor is negotiated/inspected by peers.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * VERSIONING POLICY  (same shape as opendisplay_protocol.h, scoped to PAYLOAD
 *                     layout instead of framing)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   OD_STRUCTS_VERSION is MAJOR.MINOR and describes the payload SPEC in this
 *   file. It is a compatibility / documentation marker, NOT transmitted.
 *
 *   Bump MAJOR (x.0) for a BREAKING layout change -- one that makes a peer
 *   built against the previous version misread payload bytes:
 *     - moving, resizing, renumbering, or re-typing an existing field;
 *     - changing a field's endianness or a struct's total wire size;
 *     - removing or renumbering an enum value / bit / packet-type id;
 *     - changing the packed layout / offset of any field.
 *   Reset MINOR to 0 on every MAJOR bump.
 *
 *   Bump MINOR (2.x) for a BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE addition -- old peers keep
 *   working unchanged:
 *     - naming a byte carved out of a reserved[] block (the bytes were already
 *       must-be-zero, so old peers still interop) -- e.g. WifiConfig's server
 *       fields, the DisplayConfig cs_pin_2 promotion;
 *     - adding a NEW enum value, bitfield bit, or packet-type id that leaves
 *       existing ones untouched;
 *     - appending a NEW optional trailing field old parsers ignore.
 *
 *   NO bump for comment / prose clarifications, or renaming a field to its
 *   canonical spelling when the byte offset and size are unchanged.
 *
 *   Rule of thumb -- "could a peer on the previous version misread the bytes?"
 *     yes                         -> MAJOR
 *     no, but something new added -> MINOR
 *     neither                     -> no bump
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CHANGELOG  (newest first; entries accrue under "Unreleased" and roll into a
 *            new version heading on each bump -- see AGENT INSTRUCTIONS below)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Unreleased (since 2.0)
 *     - LOCAL FORK DIVERGENCE (not from upstream opendisplay-protocol, not
 *       synced): new struct PipeSlotExt, the slot-target twin of
 *       PipePartialExt (see opendisplay_protocol.h's PIPE_FLAG_SLOT_TARGET).
 *       Added directly in this Firmware clone; a future sync from upstream
 *       will need to reconcile this file by hand.
 *     - Doc-only: fixed two comment shapes the codegen parser mis-read and added
 *       the CODEGEN AUTHORING RULES banner section to prevent recurrence. Split the
 *       combined BusFlags/PinBitmap @bits comment into one comment per group; folded
 *       OuterPacketHeader's trailing FOLLOWUP note inside its @doc quote. No wire
 *       change; regenerated the language mirrors.
 *     - Named the skipped/reserved bits inside two bitfield groups with explicit
 *       placeholder macros (no wire change; these bits stay reserved-must-be-0):
 *       TransmissionModes bit5/bit6 -> OD_TRANSMISSION_MODE_RESERVED_5/_6;
 *       MsdStatusBits bit3 -> OD_MSD_STATUS_RESERVED_3. Documentation only.
 *     - Add each payload-layout change here as it lands. On the next version bump,
 *       move these under a new "MAJOR.MINOR (YYYY-MM-DD)" heading.
 *
 *   2.0  (2026-07-18)
 *     - Initial canonical shared payload contract: the wire-payload counterpart
 *       to opendisplay_protocol.h, reconciling the per-repo opendisplay_structs.h
 *       / structs.h supersets and the website config.yaml (ble_proto v1.4) into
 *       one self-documenting header vendored into all firmware repos.
 *     - 15 config TLV packet structs + 2 framing structs + 9 message/advert
 *       structs, all packed with sizeof static-asserts; 19 value enums; the
 *       bitfield groups; and the loose wire constants (OD_CONFIG_VERSION pair,
 *       CRC constants, OD_PIN_UNUSED).
 *     - Reconciliations (superset of every source; total sizes unchanged):
 *       SystemConfig pwr_pin_2/3 named; ManufacturerData simple_config_* named;
 *       PowerOption charge/min_wake/screen_timeout tail named; DisplayConfig
 *       cs_pin_2 + full_update_mC + legacy_tag_type; SensorData i2c_addr_7bit +
 *       msd_data_start_byte; BinaryInputs input_pin_1..8 / pins_used +
 *       power_off_flags / power_off_hold_sec.
 *     - ColorScheme value 7 = SEVEN_COLOR (config.yaml "7color"); the former
 *       firmware COLOR_SCHEME_GRAY8 = 7 was a mistake and is dropped outright
 *       (no gray8 at any value).
 *     - WifiConfig extended AHEAD of firmware: server_host[64] + server_port
 *       (big-endian) promoted out of reserved[] (backward-compatible carve).
 *     - Message payloads (previously hand-parsed and drifting in Swift/JS) given
 *       a single machine-readable home: LedFlashPattern, MsdAdvertisement,
 *       PipeStartRequest/Response, PipePartialExt, PipeSack,
 *       PartialWriteStartHeader (all-big-endian geometry), AuthChallenge,
 *       AuthProof.

 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AGENT INSTRUCTIONS -- changelog upkeep (perform on EVERY edit to this file)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. Set LAST CHANGED (top) to the date of your edit.
 *   2. Add a bullet describing the change under "Unreleased (since x.y)".
 *   3. Classify the change via the VERSIONING POLICY above: layout-breaking =>
 *      MAJOR, backward-compatible addition => MINOR, doc-only => no bump.
 *   4. VALIDATE before finishing: confirm the accumulated "Unreleased" entries
 *      are consistent with OD_STRUCTS_VERSION. When a bump is warranted, update
 *      OD_STRUCTS_VERSION_MAJOR / _MINOR / _STR, add a new "MAJOR.MINOR
 *      (YYYY-MM-DD)" heading, move the Unreleased entries beneath it (reset
 *      MINOR to 0 on a MAJOR bump), and leave "Unreleased" empty.
 *   5. If a change alters the ON-WIRE format, also bump OD_CONFIG_VERSION /
 *      OD_CONFIG_MINOR_VERSION and note it -- that pair is independent of the
 *      spec marker and is what peers actually negotiate.
 *   6. Never delete or rewrite historical entries -- the changelog is append-only.
 *   7. Every packed struct MUST keep its trailing
 *      OD_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(struct X) == N, ...); if you change a layout,
 *      change the asserted size to match (and treat it as a MAJOR change).
 *
 * CANONICAL LOCATION
 *   opendisplay-protocol/src/opendisplay_structs.h
 *
 *   VENDORED COPY IN FIRMWARE REPOS -- DO NOT EDIT THERE.
 *   Sync every copy byte-for-byte via tools/sync_protocol_header.py (same
 *   mechanism as opendisplay_protocol.h; same include guard so the vendored
 *   file is a drop-in replacement for each repo's existing opendisplay_structs.h).
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LANGUAGE / LINKAGE RULE  (INVERTED from opendisplay_protocol.h)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   opendisplay_protocol.h is macro-only. THIS header is the opposite: it
 *   intentionally CONTAINS real `enum`s and packed `struct`s -- that is its
 *   purpose (they are the codegen source). It must still compile clean as BOTH
 *   C99 and C++, the same gate as protocol.h:
 *       cc  -std=c99 -fsyntax-only src/opendisplay_structs.h
 *       c++          -fsyntax-only src/opendisplay_structs.h
 *   Constraints that keep it portable and drop-in:
 *     - Enums are PLAIN (not `enum class`); every enumerator has an EXPLICIT
 *       value and an `OD_` prefix (unprefixed spellings such as
 *       COLOR_SCHEME_MONO are live macros in the firmware repos, so an
 *       `OD_`-prefixed enumerator lets both coexist during migration).
 *     - Struct and field names match the firmware repos EXACTLY (DisplayConfig,
 *       instance_number, ...) so the vendored header is a drop-in.
 *     - NO functions. NO typedefs of RAM-only / in-memory types. NO
 *       repo-specific values (GPIO pin values, buffer sizes, GlobalConfig,
 *       EncryptionSession, ImageData, PipeWriteState, ButtonState). Those move
 *       to a repo-local header on adoption -- mirror of protocol.h's "no
 *       typedefs here" rule, inverted: "no in-memory / RAM-only types here".
 *     - This header #includes opendisplay_protocol.h and NEVER redeclares a name
 *       it already `#define`s. protocol.h defines OD_NFC_IC_* as MACROS; an
 *       `enum` member of the same spelling would be textually rewritten by the
 *       macro and fail to compile. So the nfc_ic_type field is @enum-bound to
 *       protocol.h's OD_NFC_IC_* rather than re-enumerated here; likewise pipe
 *       flags bind to protocol.h's PIPE_FLAG_*.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BLOB-WIDE CONVENTIONS  (from config.yaml `meta`; hold for EVERY struct here)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   (1) BYTE ORDER is LITTLE-ENDIAN by default. Multi-byte fields are LE unless
 *       a field carries an `@endian be` tag. The big-endian exceptions in this
 *       header are: WifiConfig.server_port, and the ENTIRE PartialWriteStartHeader
 *       (0x76) geometry. (Note the PIPE 0x80 partial extension packs the same
 *       geometry LITTLE-endian -- see PipePartialExt.)
 *   (2) All wire structs are PACKED (__attribute__((packed)); no implicit
 *       padding between fields.
 *   (3) RESERVED fields MUST be written as 0 and are ignored by older parsers
 *       (this is what makes carving names out of reserved[] backward-compatible).
 *   (4) BITFIELDS number from bit 0 = LSB. Unused bits MUST be 0.
 *
 *   Two more file-wide notes:
 *     - OuterPacketHeader.length FOLLOWUP: the leading u16 `length` is populated
 *       inconsistently across encoders -- the website toolbox patches it to the
 *       real total, but some encoders leave it as a zero pad. The CRC is ALWAYS
 *       computed as if `length` were 0x0000 regardless. Do not rely on `length`
 *       until the contract is pinned; see OuterPacketHeader below.
 *     - Silicon-specific pin ENCODINGS (e.g. nRF54 (port<<4)|pin, Silabs 0xPN)
 *       are target-defined: every pin field here is a raw u8; its bit encoding
 *       is decided by the receiving firmware, not by this header.
 *     - The image dither-algorithm ids (DitherMode) are owned by epaper-dithering
 *       and are NOT wire values -- they appear in no packet here and are omitted.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TAG CONVENTION  (machine-readable annotations for codegen; live in the SAME
 * trailing comment as the human prose. grep-able, line-anchored.)
 *   @packet 0xNN        this struct is config TLV packet-type 0xNN
 *   @message CMD_X      this struct is the fixed payload of opcode CMD_X
 *   @required           config packet MUST be present in a valid blob
 *   @repeatable [max=N] config packet MAY repeat, up to N instances (absent => 1)
 *   @enum <Name>        field's values are the named enum (may reference protocol.h)
 *   @bits <Group>       field is a bitfield of the named group
 *   @endian le|be       multi-byte field byte order (default le; be must be tagged)
 *   @reserved           must-be-zero forward-compat padding
 *   @unit <u>           physical unit of the value (px, mm, mC, ms, s, mAh, uA)
 *   @min/@max/@default  bounded-integer range / default value
 *   @since <cfgver>     on-wire config version the field/value first appeared in
 *   @changed "<note>"   wire-visible change history for the item
 *   @width <bytes>      intended on-wire width of an enum
 *   @external <comp>    enum mirrors / relates to an outside component
 *   @doc "<text>"       human prose (also the primary deliverable of this file)
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CODEGEN AUTHORING RULES  (AGENT INSTRUCTIONS -- keep tools/structs_model.py able
 * to parse this file; the stdlib parser hard-errors or MIS-ATTRIBUTES on anything
 * outside this shape, and the Python/JS/... mirrors are GENERATED from here)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A. One shape per construct, one declaration per line (no `uint8_t a, b;`):
 *        - enum Name { OD_X = <int literal>, ... };   explicit values, OD_-prefixed.
 *        - struct Name { <uintN_t> f; <uintN_t> f[<int literal>]; ... }
 *              __attribute__((packed));   fixed-width scalars/arrays ONLY -- NO C
 *              bitfields (uint8_t x:3), unions, nested structs, or macro-sized arrays.
 *        - #define OD_..._NAME (1u << N)   for bit flags (mask/shift consts allowed).
 *   B. Every packed struct ENDS with OD_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(struct X) == N, ...);
 *      the parser sums the field widths and validates them against N -- that assert
 *      IS the layout oracle (it replaces a compiler front-end). Keep it exact.
 *   C. Each @bits group gets its OWN group comment. Do NOT describe two @bits groups
 *      in one comment block: the parser attaches one comment per group, so a shared
 *      block mis-labels the later group. (Regression fixed 2026-07-18.)
 *   D. ALL prose that must reach the generated docs goes INSIDE the `@doc "..."`
 *      quotes. Text AFTER the closing quote (trailing notes, `FOLLOWUP:` lines) is
 *      DROPPED by the parser -- fold such notes into the quoted @doc. (Fixed 2026-07-18.)
 *   E. Never redeclare a name opendisplay_protocol.h `#define`s; bind fields to it
 *      with @enum instead (see LANGUAGE / LINKAGE RULE above).
 *   F. AFTER ANY EDIT to values/layout/docs, regenerate the mirrors and confirm no
 *      drift (do this in the same change, like protocol.h's gen tools):
 *        python3 tools/gen_python_structs.py --write   # then commit the .py
 *        python3 tools/gen_python_structs.py --check    # CI gate; exit 1 on drift
 *      (add the same for future JS/Swift emitters as they land).
