/* ==========================================================================
 * opendisplay_protocol.h  --  OpenDisplay BLE wire-protocol contract
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   Single source of truth for every value that travels on the OpenDisplay
 *   BLE wire: command opcodes, response/status bytes, auth states, error
 *   codes, and the sub-protocol constants for NFC and the sliding-window
 *   image PIPE. A new engineer or an AI agent should be able to implement a
 *   fully-correct client from THIS FILE ALONE, without reading firmware.
 *
 *   OD_PROTOCOL_VERSION 2.2   (MAJOR.MINOR; see VERSIONING POLICY below)
 *   LAST CHANGED        2026-08-30
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * VERSIONING POLICY
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   The version is MAJOR.MINOR and describes the SPEC in THIS file. It is a
 *   compatibility / documentation marker and is NOT transmitted on the wire.
 *   (The on-wire, negotiated PIPE_VERSION used by the 0x0080 sub-protocol is a
 *   separate field, versioned independently.)
 *
 *   Bump MAJOR (x.0) for a BREAKING wire change -- one that makes a peer built
 *   against the previous version misread bytes or lose interoperability:
 *     - changing the value or meaning of an existing opcode, response/status
 *       byte, auth state, or error code (e.g. the NFC 0x0082 -> 0x0083 move
 *       that defines 2.0);
 *     - changing an existing message's request/response layout, field size,
 *       endianness, or a framing rule (opcode width, envelope, auth gating);
 *     - removing or renumbering any existing command / response / error code.
 *   Reset MINOR to 0 on every MAJOR bump.
 *
 *   Bump MINOR (2.x) for a BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE addition -- old peers keep
 *   working unchanged, new peers gain capability:
 *     - adding a NEW command opcode, response/status byte, error code, NFC
 *       sub-command, or NFC record type that leaves existing ones untouched;
 *     - appending a NEW optional, length-discriminated field to an existing
 *       message that old parsers safely ignore;
 *     - widening a documented limit / range in a compatible direction.
 *
 *   NO bump for changes that do not alter wire behavior -- comment / spec
 *   clarifications, or adding an @targets entry when a firmware merely starts
 *   implementing an already-defined opcode. Record those in git history and
 *   reserve version bumps for real spec changes.
 *
 *   Rule of thumb -- "could a peer on the previous version misread the wire?"
 *     yes                         -> MAJOR
 *     no, but something new added -> MINOR
 *     neither                     -> no bump
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CHANGELOG  (newest first; entries accrue under "Unreleased" and roll into a
 *            new version heading on each bump -- see AGENT INSTRUCTIONS below)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Unreleased (since 2.2)
 *     - LAN framing: cap the WIRE frame ([len:2 LE] prefix + payload) at a new
 *       constant OD_LAN_MAX_FRAME (4096); OD_LAN_MAX_PAYLOAD is now DERIVED as
 *       OD_LAN_MAX_FRAME - 2 = 4094 (was a standalone 4096, which made the max
 *       wire frame an awkward 4098). Senders MUST keep payloads <= 4094 and
 *       receivers MUST reject len > 4094. Breaking only for senders that framed
 *       4095/4096-byte payloads (none deployed); max DIRECT_WRITE chunk data on
 *       LAN is now OD_LAN_MAX_PAYLOAD - 2 = 4092.
 *     - BLE framing: add OD_BLE_MAX_FRAME (256) as the named BLE transport
 *       ceiling -- the ATT MTU, counting opcode(1) + handle(2) + value, so the
 *       usable single-write value is 253. This is the BLE peer of
 *       OD_LAN_MAX_FRAME and codifies a limit the wire already had: PIPE_MAX_FRAME
 *       (244) is the frame ceiling, and nRF peripherals are hard-capped at ATT MTU
 *       247 (payload 244) by the SoftDevice. Peers SHOULD declare their GATT value
 *       length and preferred MTU at OD_BLE_MAX_FRAME rather than the 512 ATT
 *       maximum, so an oversize write draws ATT error 0x0D instead of being
 *       silently dropped. Breaking only for peers that wrote >253 bytes in a
 *       single GATT write (none deployed -- HA's GATT client caps at 244 and
 *       rejects larger writes outright).
 *     - LOCAL FORK DIVERGENCE (not from upstream opendisplay-protocol, not
 *       synced -- see PIPE_FLAG_SLOT_TARGET below and its CMD_PIPE_WRITE_START
 *       doc extension). Added directly in this Firmware clone because this
 *       project isn't pursuing an upstream contribution for it. A future sync
 *       from upstream opendisplay-protocol will need to reconcile this file
 *       and opendisplay_structs.h by hand.
 *     - MINOR: new PIPE_FLAG_SLOT_TARGET (flags bit2) on CMD_PIPE_WRITE_START --
 *       writes the transfer into an on-device PSRAM "slot" instead of the
 *       live panel. Mutually exclusive with PIPE_FLAG_PARTIAL (bit1). Adds a
 *       6-byte PipeSlotExt trailing extension (see opendisplay_structs.h) and
 *       two new OD_ERR_PIPE_START_* codes (0x04 SLOT_INVALID, 0x08
 *       SLOT_TOO_LARGE). CMD_PIPE_WRITE_END on a slot-target transfer does not
 *       refresh the panel -- see the CMD_PIPE_WRITE_START doc block. Additive,
 *       backward-compatible: old peers never set bit2 and are unaffected.
 *     - MINOR: new CMD_SLOT_SWITCH (0x0084) -- LOCAL FORK DIVERGENCE, not
 *       upstream. [slot_id:1] request; switches the panel to that PSRAM slot
 *       immediately, server-driven -- the BLE equivalent of a local button
 *       press (odDisplayJumpToSlot()). Until now there was NO way to change
 *       which slot is on screen over BLE; a slot-target CMD_PIPE_WRITE_END
 *       only auto-refreshes when it happens to target the slot already
 *       selected. Adds the OD_ERR_SLOT_SWITCH_* namespace (SECTION 4e).
 *       Additive: old peers never send 0x0084 and are unaffected.
 *     - Add each further wire-spec change here as it lands. On the next version
 *       bump, move these under a new "MAJOR.MINOR (YYYY-MM-DD)" heading.
 *
 *   2.2  (2026-07-22)
 *     - MINOR: new SECTION 9 -- NETWORK TRANSPORT (LAN). Documents the WiFi/LAN
 *       transport as a first-class, implement-from-this-file-alone contract:
 *       framed TCP ([len:2 LE][payload], payload 1..OD_LAN_MAX_PAYLOAD) over a
 *       plaintext OR TLS-PSK channel selected by isEncryptionEnabled(). Adds the
 *       OD_LAN_* constants (OD_LAN_TCP_PORT 2446u, OD_LAN_TLS_PORT 2447u,
 *       OD_LAN_MAX_PAYLOAD 4096u, OD_LAN_MDNS_SERVICE "_opendisplay._tcp",
 *       OD_LAN_READ_TIMEOUT_S 30u). No new opcodes, no struct change: the
 *       plaintext port comes from WifiConfig.server_port (default OD_LAN_TCP_PORT)
 *       and the TLS port is DERIVED as server_port + 1. Additive -- BLE peers on
 *       2.1 are unaffected (no wire bytes on the existing BLE path change).
 *
 *   2.1  (2026-07-18)
 *     - MINOR: new CMD_POWER_OFF (0x0052) -- explicit hard rail-cut via the
 *       D-FF power latch; wakes ONLY on a physical button. Fire-and-forget
 *       (ACK queued best-effort, usually dies before the rail is cut). Adds
 *       RESP_POWER_OFF (0x52) and the scoped OD_ERR_POWER_OFF_* namespace
 *       (SECTION 4d).
 *     - CMD_DEEP_SLEEP is opcode 0x0053. It documents its optional one-shot
 *       [seconds:2 BE] wake-timer payload (originally shipped on 0x0052,
 *       Firmware PR #97) and gains the scoped OD_ERR_DEEP_SLEEP_* NACK
 *       namespace (SECTION 4c: 0x00 unsupported, 0x01 disabled, 0x02
 *       not-battery). Client rule: 0x01/0x02 mean "rejected, still awake".
 *     - BREAKING vs shipped firmware: CMD_DEEP_SLEEP moved 0x0052 -> 0x0053,
 *       swapped with CMD_POWER_OFF so power-off takes the lower number. Since
 *       0x0052 = deep-sleep shipped in Firmware PR #97, a peer on the old
 *       mapping now hits the wrong command. Corrected in place within the
 *       (unreleased) 2.1 line rather than a MAJOR bump (amended 2026-07-19).
 *     - BEHAVIORAL: target design for CMD_DEEP_SLEEP (0x0053) on D-FF-latch
 *       ESP32 changes from power-off to timer-wake deep sleep (latch held, like
 *       non-latch boards); the hard rail-cut is CMD_POWER_OFF (0x0052).
 *     - Doc-only: LANGUAGE / LINKAGE RULE now requires macro VALUES to stay
 *       simple (literal or reference to a prior macro) so the header stays
 *       parseable by tools/gen_python_protocol.py. No wire bytes change.
 *
 *   2.0  (2026-07-15)
 *     - Initial shared protocol contract: one self-documenting header vendored
 *       into all firmware repos (Firmware, NRF54, Silabs, NRF52811).
 *     - BREAKING: NFC endpoint moved 0x0082 -> 0x0083 to resolve the collision
 *       with CMD_PIPE_WRITE_END; clean cutover, no legacy alias. This move
 *       defines the 2.x line.
 *     - Union superset of every repo's commands / responses / auth states /
 *       error codes, with per-opcode tagged spec blocks.
 *     - Established MAJOR.MINOR versioning policy, this changelog, and the
 *       LAST CHANGED field.
 *     - Opcode-scoped, prefixed NACK error namespaces (OD_ERR_PARTIAL_* for
 *       0x76, OD_ERR_PIPE_START_* for the 0x80 START, NFC_ERR_* for 0x83) and
 *       the scoping rule that data[0] is always decoded in the scope of the
 *       echoed opcode -- there is no global error enum, and byte values are
 *       reused across namespaces with different meanings. Names/comments only;
 *       no wire bytes change (these constants are new in 2.0, unconsumed).
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AGENT INSTRUCTIONS -- changelog upkeep (perform on EVERY edit to this file)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. Set LAST CHANGED (top) to the date of your edit.
 *   2. Add a bullet describing the change under "Unreleased (since x.y)".
 *   3. Classify the change via the VERSIONING POLICY above: breaking => MAJOR,
 *      backward-compatible addition => MINOR, doc-only => no bump.
 *   4. VALIDATE before finishing: confirm the accumulated "Unreleased" entries
 *      are consistent with OD_PROTOCOL_VERSION. If ANY entry is breaking, MAJOR
 *      must be bumped; if any adds wire capability, at least MINOR must be
 *      bumped. When a bump is warranted: update OD_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MAJOR /
 *      _MINOR / _STR, add a new "MAJOR.MINOR (YYYY-MM-DD)" heading, move the
 *      Unreleased entries beneath it (reset MINOR to 0 on a MAJOR bump), and
 *      leave "Unreleased (since x.y)" empty.
 *   5. Never delete or rewrite historical entries -- the changelog is append-only.
 *
 * CANONICAL LOCATION
 *   opendisplay-protocol/src/opendisplay_protocol.h
 *
 *   VENDORED COPY IN FIRMWARE REPOS -- DO NOT EDIT THERE.
 *   Sync every copy byte-for-byte via tools/sync_protocol_header.py:
 *       Firmware/include/opendisplay_protocol.h
 *       Firmware_NRF54/src/opendisplay_protocol.h
 *       Firmware_Silabs/opendisplay_protocol.h
 *       Firmware_NRF/opendisplay_protocol.h
 *   CI runs `sync_protocol_header.py --check` (a hash compare) in each repo.
 *
 * LANGUAGE / LINKAGE RULE
 *   MACRO-ONLY. Every constant is a `#define`, `u`-suffixed. Macros have no
 *   linkage, so this header is safe to `#include` from C and C++ translation
 *   units with NO `extern "C"` block. Do not add typedefs, enums, structs, or
 *   functions here -- those are per-repo and belong in opendisplay_structs.h /
 *   opendisplay_constants.h. Keep the include guard OPENDISPLAY_PROTOCOL_H so
 *   the vendored copies are drop-in replacements.
 *   KEEP MACRO VALUES SIMPLE: an integer literal (0x...u / ...u), a string
 *   literal, or a reference to a macro already defined above. No expressions
 *   (e.g. `(1u << 3)`), casts, or multi-token values. This keeps the header
 *   parseable by tools/gen_python_protocol.py, which mirrors these constants
 *   into src/opendisplay_protocol.py (the Python single-source equivalent of
 *   the byte-for-byte firmware vendoring) and hard-errors on any other shape.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * UNIVERSAL FRAMING
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   REQUEST (host -> device):
 *       [cmd_hi][cmd_lo][payload...]
 *     - Opcode is 2 bytes, BIG-ENDIAN (e.g. 0x0041 -> bytes 0x00 0x41).
 *     - Payload layout is per-command (see each @request below). Multi-byte
 *       payload fields are LITTLE-ENDIAN unless a block says "BE".
 *
 *   RESPONSE / NOTIFICATION (device -> host):
 *       [status][cmd_echo][data...]
 *     - status   : 0x00 = ACK (RESP_ACK)
 *                  0xFF = NACK (RESP_NACK); a NACK's data[0] is often an
 *                         error code (OD_ERR_PARTIAL_* / OD_ERR_PIPE_START_* /
 *                         NFC_ERR_* / handler-local).
 *                  0xFE = auth required (RESP_AUTH_REQUIRED); sent for any
 *                         gated command when security is on but no session.
 *     - cmd_echo : the LOW byte of the command (RESP_* mirror the low byte of
 *                  the matching CMD_*; e.g. CMD_CONFIG_WRITE 0x0041 echoes
 *                  RESP_CONFIG_WRITE 0x41).
 *
 *   NACK ERROR-CODE SCOPING RULE (READ THIS)
 *     - The NACK error code in data[0] is ALWAYS interpreted in the SCOPE of the
 *       echoed opcode (byte 1). There is deliberately NO single global error
 *       enum: each opcode's handler owns its own prefixed namespace, so the same
 *       byte value carries DIFFERENT meanings under different opcodes.
 *     - Concrete overlap: a NACK byte 0x03 means OD_ERR_PARTIAL_RECT_OOB under a
 *       0x76 NACK ([0xFF][0x76][0x03][0x00]) but OD_ERR_PIPE_START_SIZE_MISMATCH
 *       under a 0x80 NACK ([0xFF][0x80][0x03][0x00]). Decode data[0] only after
 *       you know byte 1. See SECTION 4 for the full per-opcode error namespaces.
 *     - Some frames are unsolicited device->host notifications (refresh
 *       success/timeout); they use the same [status][echo] shape.
 *
 *   ENCRYPTED ENVELOPE (when a security session is active):
 *       [cmd:2 BE][nonce:16][ciphertext][tag:12]
 *     - Inner plaintext (what the ciphertext protects): [len:1][payload]
 *       where len is the payload byte count.
 *     - AAD (additional authenticated data) = the 2 plaintext opcode bytes.
 *     - AEAD = AES-128-CCM, 12-byte tag (ENCRYPTION_TAG_SIZE), 16-byte nonce
 *       (ENCRYPTION_NONCE_SIZE); the CCM 13-byte nonce is nonce[3..15].
 *     - ALWAYS-PLAINTEXT commands/responses (never encrypted, so a client can
 *       bootstrap a session): AUTHENTICATE (0x50) and FIRMWARE_VERSION (0x43);
 *       on Firmware_Silabs, READ_MSD (0x44) is also plaintext.
 *
 *   AUTH GATING
 *     - When security is enabled, EVERY command except AUTHENTICATE requires a
 *       live authenticated session; otherwise the device replies
 *       [0xFE][cmd_echo] (RESP_AUTH_REQUIRED) and drops the request.
 *
 *   CHUNK BUDGETS (max DATA bytes per frame, image/direct-write path)
 *     - Unencrypted : 230 bytes.
 *     - Encrypted   : 154 bytes  (packet = cmd2 + nonce16 + len1 + 154 + tag12
 *                     = 185 <= MTU-derived ceiling). Config chunks are capped
 *                     separately at CONFIG_CHUNK_SIZE (200).

 * SECTION 4 -- OPCODE-SCOPED NACK ERROR NAMESPACES
 * ==========================================================================
 * NACK error bytes are opcode-SCOPED, never global: data[0] of a NACK is only
 * meaningful once you know the echoed opcode (byte 1). This section holds the
 * distinct, PREFIXED error namespaces -- one per handler -- so a byte value can
 * be reused with different meanings and stay unambiguous on the wire. The NFC
 * namespace lives in SECTION 5 (NFC_ERR_*, the 4th byte of
 * [0xFF][0x83][0xFF][err]); it is cross-referenced but NOT redefined here.
 *
 * SCOPING RULE
 *   The 0x76 (OD_ERR_PARTIAL_*) and 0x80-START (OD_ERR_PIPE_START_*) sets below
 *   DELIBERATELY REUSE byte values 0x03, 0x05, 0x06 and 0x07 with DIFFERENT
 *   meanings. They must NEVER be cross-applied: the echoed opcode is the only
 *   thing that disambiguates them. E.g. byte 0x03 == OD_ERR_PARTIAL_RECT_OOB
 *   under a 0x76 NACK but OD_ERR_PIPE_START_SIZE_MISMATCH under a 0x80 NACK.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (for firmware handlers adopting these constants)
 *   - A handler for CMD_PARTIAL_WRITE_START (0x76), and the 0x71/0x72 frames of
 *     that partial session, MUST emit ONLY OD_ERR_PARTIAL_* codes.
 *   - A handler for CMD_PIPE_WRITE_START (0x80) MUST emit ONLY
 *     OD_ERR_PIPE_START_* codes.
 *   - The NFC handler (CMD_NFC_ENDPOINT 0x83) MUST emit ONLY NFC_ERR_* codes
 *     (SECTION 5).
 *   - The CMD_POWER_OFF handler (0x52) MUST emit ONLY OD_ERR_POWER_OFF_*
 *     codes (SECTION 4d); the CMD_DEEP_SLEEP handler (0x53) ONLY
 *     OD_ERR_DEEP_SLEEP_* codes (SECTION 4c).
 *   A code from one namespace must NEVER appear in another handler's NACK. The
 *   overlapping raw byte values are intentional and safe ONLY because the echoed
 *   opcode scopes them -- pick the constant by which opcode you are answering.

/* ==========================================================================
 * SECTION 9 -- NETWORK TRANSPORT (LAN)
 * ==========================================================================
 * The OpenDisplay command set can also ride a LAN (WiFi) TCP transport, in
 * addition to BLE. This section is the implement-from-this-file-alone contract
 * for that transport. It is ADDITIVE: it introduces no new opcodes and no
 * struct fields -- the same SECTION 1 commands / SECTION 2 responses travel
 * inside a framed TCP stream. BLE-only peers are unaffected.
 *
 * FRAME FORMAT
 *   Each application message is length-prefixed on the TCP byte stream:
 *       [len:2 LE][payload]
 *     - len     : 16-bit LITTLE-ENDIAN byte count of the payload that follows.
 *     - payload : one command/response frame, EXACTLY as on BLE but WITHOUT the
 *                 GATT MTU segmentation -- i.e. [cmd_hi][cmd_lo][payload...] for
 *                 a request, [status][cmd_echo][data...] for a response.
 *     - The complete WIRE frame (2-byte prefix + payload) MUST NOT exceed
 *       OD_LAN_MAX_FRAME (4096); equivalently, valid payload length is
 *       1..OD_LAN_MAX_PAYLOAD (= OD_LAN_MAX_FRAME - 2 = 4094). len == 0 is
 *       invalid; len > OD_LAN_MAX_PAYLOAD MUST be rejected and the connection
 *       dropped. Capping the WIRE frame (not the payload) at a power of two is
 *       deliberate: receiver buffers sized in wire bytes divide evenly.
 *   A reader MUST handle partial and coalesced TCP reads: read exactly 2 bytes
 *   for len, then exactly len bytes for the payload.
 *
 * NORMATIVE RULES
 *   (1) MODE / PORT SELECTION -- one channel, chosen by the firmware predicate
 *       isEncryptionEnabled() (SecurityConfig.encryption_enabled == 1 AND a
 *       non-zero 16-byte master key):
 *         - false -> PLAINTEXT framed TCP on the configured WifiConfig.server_port
 *                    (default OD_LAN_TCP_PORT if server_port == 0) ONLY.
 *         - true  -> TLS-PSK on the DERIVED port server_port + 1
 *                    (default OD_LAN_TLS_PORT == OD_LAN_TCP_PORT + 1) ONLY.
 *       A flag == 1 with a blank/all-zero key is NOT "encrypted" -- it falls back
 *       to plaintext. The two modes are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE: exactly one port is
 *       served at a time. Clients learn the live port from the mDNS SRV record
 *       (see rule 6) or authoritatively via CONFIG_READ (0x26): read server_port,
 *       add 1 for the TLS port.
 *   (2) NO PIPE ON LAN -- the sliding-window image PIPE (0x0080 / 0x0081 / 0x0082,
 *       SECTION 6) MUST NOT be used on this transport; TCP already provides
 *       ordered, reliable, flow-controlled delivery. Stream image data via
 *       DIRECT_WRITE with chunks of at most OD_LAN_MAX_PAYLOAD - 2 data bytes.
 *   (3) ONE CLIENT AT A TIME -- the device serves a single network client; a new
 *       connection EVICTS the prior one. Clients MAY stay persistently connected;
 *       the server drops a client only after OD_LAN_READ_TIMEOUT_S with no
 *       traffic. Any valid command resets the idle timer.
 *   (4) TLS-PSK / NO DOUBLE ENCRYPTION -- on the encrypted channel the PSK is
 *       DERIVED from the SecurityConfig master key via the existing CMAC KDF
 *       (the same key derivation used elsewhere); prefer an ECDHE-PSK
 *       ciphersuite. The TLS handshake IS the authentication: the app-layer
 *       AUTHENTICATE (0x50) exchange is NOT used on this port. There is NO double
 *       encryption -- INSIDE the TLS tunnel, frames are PLAINTEXT opcode frames
 *       and the app-layer AES-CCM envelope (SECTION 8) MUST NOT be applied. The
 *       dispatcher MUST gate app-layer decrypt/encrypt on the frame's ORIGIN
 *       transport (TLS-origin bypasses the AEAD envelope; BLE-origin keeps it),
 *       NOT on the global isEncryptionEnabled() flag.
 *   (5) IDENTITY -- the BLE MAC is the cross-transport identity anchor. The BLE
 *       manufacturer-specific data (MSD) is VOLATILE telemetry, NOT identity.
 *       Correlate a discovered LAN device to its BLE identity via the `mac` mDNS
 *       TXT key (rule 6); the IP address is only a locator, never an identity.
 *   (6) DISCOVERY -- mDNS / DNS-SD. Service OD_LAN_MDNS_SERVICE
 *       ("_opendisplay._tcp"; FQDN "_opendisplay._tcp.local."). TXT record keys:
 *         mac : REQUIRED. The advertised BLE address, lowercase colon-separated
 *               (e.g. "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff") -- this is the ADVERTISED BLE address,
 *               NOT the eFuse / WiFi MAC.
 *         tls : REQUIRED. "0" or "1"; mirrors isEncryptionEnabled() (1 = the
 *               served channel is TLS-PSK on server_port + 1).
 *         fw  : RECOMMENDED. Firmware version "major.minor".
 *         cm  : RECOMMENDED. communication_modes, 2 lowercase hex digits.
 *         id  : OPTIONAL. device_id, 8 hex digits.
 *         pv  : OPTIONAL. protocol version (e.g. "2.2").
 *         msd : EXISTING. 28 lowercase hex digits of volatile telemetry; throttle
 *               republish to >= 400 ms.
 *       The SRV record port MUST equal the ACTIVE mode's port: server_port when
 *       tls == 0, server_port + 1 when tls == 1. On a config change that flips
 *       isEncryptionEnabled(), the device MUST re-register the service on the new
 *       port (and update the `tls` TXT) so clients converge on the live channel.
