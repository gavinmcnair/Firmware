    //  - At the top, gated on isAuthenticated(): an authenticated client sending a
    //    too-short plaintext frame stamped here, then got RESP_AUTH_REQUIRED from
    //    the length check below it.

    //    dispatch, but handleWriteConfig() and the chunk handler apply their OWN
    //    app-layer auth check and can still answer RESP_AUTH_REQUIRED -- so a TLS
    //    client repeating CMD_CONFIG_WRITE stamped the clock on every rejected
    //    attempt and held the slot indefinitely.
    //
    // Both are the same mistake at different depths: anything that predicts
    // acceptance is wrong at whatever layer rejects next. Reading s_frameRejected
    // after the handler has run is the only position with nothing below it.
    //
    // Unknown opcodes do not stamp (commandName() is null for them), and the two
